# Short Response

There are 5 questions for this portion. Answer each question concisely and with a code example.

Responses should be written on looseleaf. Each question should be labeled. 

## Question 1: 

When would you use the command `mkdir` vs `touch`? Which of the two commands would you use to create a **folder** named **classrooms**?  can you write the command needed to create a folder named classrooms/. explian why you choose that command?

---

## Question 2: 

When would you use cd [folderName] instead of `cd ..`? Give an example in your own words. Provide your own example to explain the difference.

## Question 3: 

Given the following diagram, how would we **navigate** from folder **classrooms** to **cafeteria**? write the commands needed.

```bash
main/
├── classrooms/
│   ├── pd1.txt
│   └── pd2.txt
├── cafeteria/
└── gym/
```

## Question 4: 

What will the command `pwd` produce if we are currently in the folder `lunch/` based on the diagram below: 
Explain why the `pwd` command will have that result.

```bash
main/
├── classrooms/
│   ├── pd1.txt
│   └── pd2.txt
├── cafeteria/
│   ├── breakfast/
│   │   ├── pancakes-recipe.txt
│   │   └── oatmeal-recipe.txt

│       ├── chicken-wrap-recipe.txt
│       └── salads-recipe.txt
└── gym/
```

## Question 5: 

Given the following diagram **identify** a parent directory and a child directory. In your code example show how you would navigate from the **parent** to the **child**. Add another code example showing how you would navigate from the **child** to the **parent**. 

```bash
main/
├── classrooms/
│   ├── pd1.txt
│   └── pd2.txt
├── cafeteria/
│   ├── breakfast/
│   │   ├── pancakes-recipe.txt
│   │   └── oatmeal-recipe.txt
│   └── lunch/
│       ├── burgers-recipe.txt
│       ├── chicken-wrap-recipe.txt
│       └── salads-recipe.txt
└── gym/
```
