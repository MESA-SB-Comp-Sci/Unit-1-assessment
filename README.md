Now it is time to put it all to practice! Remember that this is all things that we have done in class and you are all capable of completing each task! 

## Instructions: 
There are 3 parts to this assessment, a short response portion, a project portion and a problem-solving portion. 

The short response portion has 5 questions. Provide a code example with each example. 

The project portion has 2 diagrams. Your task will be to write the commands needed to build out the diagram. 

The problem-solving portion has 2 questions and code that is incorrect! You task is to correct the errors made in the code by providing the correct line of code.
